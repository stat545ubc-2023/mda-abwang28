# Alex Wang Mini Data Analysis 
This repository is for _Alex Wang's STAT 545 Mini Data Analysis project_. For this project, I am practicing manipulating and summarizing data in tibbles using dplyr and generating questions to answer with the data (primarily in Milestone 1). Additionally I will practice making summary tables/graphs, manipulating special data types in R, fitting a model object to data and extracting a result, as well as reading and writing data as separate files (primarily in Milestone 2).

  This Repository contains a folder for the files relevant to Milestone 1 of this project (AW-MDA-Milestone-1) and for the files relevant to Milestone 2 of this project (AW-MDA-Milestone-2). There is also an Output folder, which was made to contain files written in Milestone 2 of the project.

  Code in this repository is written in R and can be run in RStudio. R and RStudio are required to execute the RMarkdown files present. To execute the files, you may locally clone/download the repository, open the RMarkdown files in RStudio, install the tidyverse, here, and broom packages if needed, and click 'knit' to knit the document to an md file.
