# Alex Wang Mini Data Analysis 1
This repository is for _Alex Wang's STAT 545 Mini Data Analysis 1 project_. For this project, I am practicing manipulating and summarizing data in tibbles using dplyr and generating questions to answer with the data.\

Code in this repository is written in R and can be run in RStudio. R and RStudio are required to execute the RMarkdown files present. To execute the files, you may locally clone/download the repository, open the RMarkdown files in RStudio, install the tidyverse packages if needed (install.packages("tidyverse") in R console), and click 'knit' to knit the document to an md file.
